# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of Swit with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Swit seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Swit, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **[INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability.
3. **Timeline**: We will provide an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
4. **Resolution**: We will develop and test a fix for the vulnerability.
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline.
6. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

Our project includes comprehensive automated security scanning:

- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanning for dependencies and container images
- **govulncheck**: Go-specific vulnerability database checking
- **gosec**: Static analysis security scanner for Go code
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated dependency vulnerability alerts

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication system
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh mechanism to minimize exposure
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for different service endpoints
- **Password Security**: Secure password hashing using industry-standard algorithms

### Infrastructure Security

- **Service Discovery**: Secure service registration and discovery using Consul
- **Database Security**: Secure database connections with proper credential management
- **Container Security**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Network Security**: Proper network segmentation and secure communication protocols

### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation across all endpoints
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use of parameterized queries and ORM
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**: Proper output encoding and sanitization
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions
   - Review dependency security advisories before adding new dependencies
   - Use `go mod tidy` to keep dependencies clean

2. **Code Review**
   - All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer
   - Security-sensitive changes require additional security review
   - Use static analysis tools before submitting pull requests

3. **Secrets Management**
   - Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords to the repository
   - Use environment variables or secure secret management systems
   - Rotate secrets regularly

4. **Testing**
   - Write security tests for authentication and authorization logic
   - Test input validation and error handling
   - Include security scenarios in integration tests

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Security**
   - Use secure configuration management
   - Enable logging and monitoring for security events
   - Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Use VPNs or private networks for internal communications

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement principle of least privilege
   - Use strong authentication for administrative access
   - Regularly audit user access and permissions

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Initial report is kept private between reporter and maintainers
2. **Investigation Period**: 90 days maximum to investigate and develop a fix
3. **Fix Development**: Develop and test security patches
4. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinate public disclosure with security advisory
5. **Credit**: Acknowledge security researchers in public advisories

### Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published:

- On GitHub Security Advisories
- In release notes for security updates
- On project documentation and website

## Security Updates

### Release Process

1. **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Emergency releases within 24-48 hours
2. **High Severity**: Releases within 1 week
3. **Medium/Low Severity**: Included in next regular release

### Notification

Security updates will be announced through:

- GitHub Releases with security tags
- Project documentation updates
- Security mailing list (if available)

## Security Tools and Commands

### Running Security Scans Locally

```bash
# Run all security checks
make security

# Run complete code quality checks (including security checks)
make quality

# Run advanced quality management (including all security checks)
make quality-advanced OPERATION=all

# Setup quality check environment (install all necessary tools)
