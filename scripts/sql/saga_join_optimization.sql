-- ============================================================================
-- Query Performance Tips for JOINs
-- ============================================================================

/*
1. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to verify JOIN strategies:
   
   EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
   SELECT * FROM saga_instances_with_step_summary 
   WHERE state = 1 LIMIT 10;

2. Prefer EXISTS over JOIN for filtering:
   
   -- Good (uses semi-join)
   SELECT * FROM saga_instances si
   WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM saga_steps ss WHERE ss.saga_id = si.id AND ss.state = 3);
   
   -- Less efficient (can produce duplicates)
   SELECT DISTINCT si.* FROM saga_instances si
   JOIN saga_steps ss ON si.id = ss.saga_id
   WHERE ss.state = 3;

3. Use LATERAL JOINs for top-N-per-group queries:
   
   SELECT si.*, recent_events.*
   FROM saga_instances si
   CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
       SELECT * FROM saga_events
       WHERE saga_id = si.id
       ORDER BY timestamp DESC
       LIMIT 5
   ) recent_events;

4. Avoid N+1 query pattern:
   
   -- Bad: Requires N+1 queries (1 for sagas, N for steps)
   SELECT * FROM saga_instances;  -- Then for each: SELECT * FROM saga_steps WHERE saga_id = ?
   
   -- Good: Use array aggregation
   SELECT si.id, array_agg(ss.name ORDER BY ss.step_index) as step_names
   FROM saga_instances si
   LEFT JOIN saga_steps ss ON si.id = ss.saga_id
   GROUP BY si.id;

5. Use appropriate JOIN types:
   
   - INNER JOIN: When you need both sides to match
   - LEFT JOIN: When you need all left-side records
   - EXISTS: When you just need to check existence
   - NOT EXISTS: More efficient than LEFT JOIN ... WHERE NULL for anti-joins

6. Index foreign keys:
   
   -- Already done in schema
   CREATE INDEX idx_step_saga_id ON saga_steps(saga_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_event_saga_id ON saga_events(saga_id);

7. Consider denormalization for frequently accessed data:
   
   -- Store aggregated counts in saga_instances instead of JOINing
   ALTER TABLE saga_instances ADD COLUMN failed_step_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
   
   -- Update with trigger or in application code

8. Use CTEs for complex queries:
   
   WITH active_sagas AS (
       SELECT * FROM saga_instances WHERE state IN (1, 2, 4)
   ),
   failed_steps AS (
       SELECT saga_id, COUNT(*) as count 
       FROM saga_steps 
       WHERE state = 3 
       GROUP BY saga_id
   )
   SELECT a.*, COALESCE(f.count, 0) as failed_steps
   FROM active_sagas a
   LEFT JOIN failed_steps f ON a.id = f.saga_id;
