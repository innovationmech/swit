# Prometheus Metrics Integration - Project Overview

## 📋 Project Status
**Status**: Planning Complete ✅  
**Epic Issue**: [#125](https://github.com/innovationmech/swit/issues/125)  
**Total Estimated Time**: 87 hours  
**Target Completion**: 10-12 weeks with 1 FTE developer

## 🎯 Project Objective

## 🏗️ Key Components to Implement

### Core Infrastructure
- **PrometheusMetricsCollector**: Prometheus-backed `MetricsCollector` implementation
- **MetricsRegistry**: Central registry for predefined and custom metrics
- **Configuration System**: `PrometheusConfig` integration with `ServerConfig`

### Transport Integration
- **HTTP Middleware**: Automatic request metrics collection
- **gRPC Interceptors**: Automatic RPC metrics collection  
- **Metrics Endpoint**: `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping

### Framework Integration
- **ObservabilityManager**: Prometheus collector integration
- **MiddlewareManager**: Automatic middleware registration
- **TransportCoordinator**: Interceptor integration
- **Performance Export**: Existing performance metrics to Prometheus

## 📈 Key Metrics Categories

### HTTP Metrics
- Request count, duration, size by method/endpoint/status
- Active request gauge
- Response size tracking

### gRPC Metrics
- RPC count, duration by method/status
- Message count and size tracking
- Started vs handled RPC comparison

### Server Metrics
- Uptime, startup/shutdown duration
- Memory usage, goroutine count, GC stats
- Service registration events

### Transport Metrics
- Transport status and health
- Connection counts and lifecycle
- Cross-transport service discovery

## 🔧 Suggested Agent Assignment

| Agent Type | Phases | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **golang-pro** | 1, 4 | Core implementation and configuration system |
| **backend-architect** | 2 | Transport layer design and integration |
| **performance-engineer** | 3 | Performance metrics and optimization |
| **golang-test-engineer** | 5 | Comprehensive testing suite |
| **general-purpose** | 5, 6 | Documentation and examples |

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Early benchmarking and optimization
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing interfaces
- **Memory Usage**: Cardinality limiting and cleanup
- **Thread Safety**: Comprehensive concurrent testing

### Medium Priority Risks  
- **Configuration Complexity**: Provide sensible defaults
- **Integration Complexity**: Phased implementation approach
- **Testing Coverage**: Automated coverage reporting
